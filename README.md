Connect to MetaMask wallet
Mint NFT by calling the smart contract on Sepolia
Store metadata on IPFS using Pinata
Beautiful UI with a responsive design
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or later)
MetaMask extension in your browser
Pinata account for IPFS storage
Sepolia ETH in your MetaMask wallet for testing
Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies.

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/nft-minting-demo.git
cd nft-minting-demo
npm install
Environment Setup
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

plaintext
Copy code
REACT_APP_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_pinata_secret_api_key
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
REACT_APP_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your_infura_project_id

REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY: Your Pinata secret API key
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: The address of your NFT contract on Sepolia
REACT_APP_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL: Infura or Alchemy Sepolia RPC URL
Running the Project
To run the project locally:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

Usage
Connect Wallet: Click "Connect Wallet" to connect your MetaMask wallet.

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Deploy the contents of the build folder to your chosen hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Error: "Insufficient minting fee"
Ensure the minting fee specified in the smart contract matches the amount being sent with the transaction.

Error: "This transaction is likely to fail"
Check that:

The correct contract address is used.
Sufficient Sepolia ETH is in the wallet.
The correct minting fee is set in the contract and front end.
MetaMask Connection Issues
Make sure MetaMask is connected to the Sepolia testnet and that you have Sepolia ETH for test transactions.
